abstract = {GreenHopper is the first Danish zero-emission ferry developed as a test platform for autonomous waterborne navigation technologies. The paper presents technology development within the innovation project ShippingLab Autonomy, which led to the commissioning of GreenHopper at Limfjorden (DK) in December 2022. The technology research resulted in a holistic system architecture for surface vessel autonomy, based on distribution of functionality and responsibility on software modules, similar to the structure observed in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Seafarers Training Certification and Watch-keeping (STCW) regulatory framework. The paper shows how this approach results in an architecture that supports safe behaviours of individual modules and of autonomous navigation at a system level. The paper presents the individual modules, specific features and benefits. Elements of the regulatory framework are highlighted to poise technology approval by maritime authorities. The paper reflects on lessons learned, discusses continued technology validation in dedicated operational scenarios.}
